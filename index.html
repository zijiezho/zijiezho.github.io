                            abstract: `As multimodal agents evolve from passive observers to long-horizon decision-makers, they require memory systems that provide not just information availability but logical verifiability. A fundamental limitation of current architectures is the epistemic asymmetry inherent in probabilistic vision-language models and dense associative memories: they conflate semantic affinity with factual existence and structurally fail to encode negative constraints. To this end, we introduce PolarMem, a training-free Polarized Latent Graph Memory designed to ground agent reasoning in verifiable evidence. PolarMem transforms fuzzy perceptual likelihoods into discrete logical constraints through non-parametric distributional partitioning. Furthermore, it employs a polarized graph topology with orthogonal inhibitory connections to explicitly store verified negation as a primary cognitive state. At inference time, we enforce a logic-dominant retrieval paradigm, suppressing hallucinatory patterns that violate negative constraints. Extensive evaluation across eight frozen Vision--Language Models and six benchmarks demonstrates that PolarMem functions as a robust cognitive system, establishing a foundation for verifiable multimodal agents.`,

                            abstract: `Recent advancements in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (mRAG), which enhance multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with external knowledge, have demonstrated that the collective intelligence of multiple agents can significantly outperform a single model through effective communication. Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M<sup>3</sup>Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M3Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.`,

                            abstract: `With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant progress has been made in research related to code automation within the field of software engineering. Among these developments, the code generation task has attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to its broad applicability. However, most existing studies focus primarily on improving the correctness of the code generated by LLMs, while overlooking the efficiency attributes of the code. As a result, LLMs often produce correct code without considering human preferences for efficiency. Efficient code not only conserves resources but also enhances the user experience. For online optimization scenarios, we find that the fixed clipping mechanism of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can lead to entropy collapse, causing premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. To address this, we propose DC-GRPO. The method employs a multi-level reward that accounts for compilation success, functional correctness, and execution efficiency to alleviate sparse-reward issues. In addition, a dynamic clipping mechanism based on a four-quadrant analysis of advantage and generation probability adapts the clipping bounds via a nonlinear mapping, encouraging low-probability/high-reward responses while suppressing high-probability/low-reward ones. In our experiments on a 1.5B-parameter code model, DC-GRPO achieves an eff@5 of 13.4%, an improvement of 1.2 percentage points over standard GRPO, and shows consistent gains over other baselines on code-oriented LLMs.`,

The proposed method combines multi-scale distillation and bidirectional feature fusion to enhance the performance of small object detection models. By leveraging the knowledge of a teacher model, the student model captures both high-level and low-level features, leading to improved detection results. Then, bidirectional feature fusion aggregates multi-layer features within the student more effectively via a convolutional attention mechanism and pyramid pooling loss function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach significantly improves small object detection performance over baselines, validating the use of multi-scale knowledge distillation and feature fusion techniques for this task.`,

                            abstract: `Measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and guidance technologies have been extensively deployed in the exploitation of oil, natural gas, and other energy resources. Conventional control approaches are plagued by challenges, including limited anti-interference capabilities and the insufficient generalization of decision-making experience. To address the intricate problem of directional well trajectory control, an intelligent algorithm design framework grounded in the high-level interaction mechanism between geology and engineering is put forward. This framework aims to facilitate the rapid batch migration and update of drilling strategies. The proposed directional well trajectory control method comprehensively considers the multi-source heterogeneous attributes of drilling experience data, leverages the generative simulation of the geological drilling environment, and promptly constructs a directional well trajectory control model with self-adaptive capabilities to environmental variations. This construction is carried out based on three hierarchical levels: “offline pre-drilling learning, online during-drilling interaction, and post-drilling model transfer”. Simulation results indicate that the guidance model derived from this method demonstrates remarkable generalization performance and accuracy. It can significantly boost the adaptability of the control algorithm to diverse environments and enhance the penetration rate of the target reservoir during drilling operations.`,

                            abstract: `&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process of oil and gas development, the decision of drilling direction is a 
                                        challenging task, and the abrasive, anisotropic, and non-homogeneous nature of stratum rocks often easily 
                                        leads to the drilling bit to deviate from the intended trajectory. The traditional method is mainly based on 
                                        pre-drilling measurement data to establish a geological model, design the borehole trajectory, and then optimize 
                                        and adjust drilling parameters, but this method often shows the problems of large trajectory deviation, weak 
                                        adaptive ability, and constrained real-time decision-making capabilities during practical drilling operations. 
                                        To overcome these problems, an innovative 3D Spatial Wide-Angle Detection (3D-SWAD) Drilling Direction Decision 
                                        Algorithm is proposed in this paper. The method introduces a spatial wide-angle detection mechanism, which can 
                                        effectively capture the 3D information of the stratum encountered during drilling by integrating the data in the 
                                        3D space near the drill bit and the information of the undrilled stratum in front of the drill bit. Through the 
                                        self-attention mechanism, the identification and utilization of key features in the drilling process are enhanced 
                                        to provide more accurate guidance decision support. The ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BiLSTM, 
                                        depthwise separable convolution, asymmetric structure, and self-attention module in the model. In addition, comparison 
                                        experiments on our own dataset and public datasets show that compared with mainstream spatio-temporal sequence models 
                                        (e.g., 3D-CNN, ConvLSTM, etc.), our model achieves a 2%-6% improvement in accuracy and a 3%-10% improvement in the probability of penetration.`,
